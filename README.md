# TV Time Youtube Feed

OK so in order to understand what I have done here, you should know that as a result of the pandemic a friend of mine has built a TV station that runs out of discord. Part of that tv station can ingest youtube videos from a text channel, download them with youtube-dl and queue them up in VLC.

Instead of waiting for us to manually notice and queue up videos and ask eachother "did you queue good mythical morning today or no" I built a process to scrape the youtube API based on an accounts subscriptions and pipe them into the text channel for youtube links.
